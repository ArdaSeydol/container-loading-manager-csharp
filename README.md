This C# project simulates and optimizes the container loading process within a logistics context. It focuses on maximizing space efficiency and maintaining proper weight distribution across container units.

## Technologies Used
- C# (.NET Core)
- Windows Forms / WPF (if GUI exists)
- Custom algorithms for loading logic

## Features
- Manual or automatic container item loading
- Capacity and volume checks
- Optimization of item arrangement
- Simple UI to visualize loading steps

## Project Structure
- `Models/`: Data structures for items and containers
- `Services/`: Loading logic and validation
- `UI/`: User interface components (if applicable)

## Future Improvements
- Load balancing with weight thresholds
- Integration with warehouse APIs
